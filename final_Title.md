Here is a revised fundamental research title that reflects the use of a Hybrid LSTM-Random Forest Model with Grey Wolf Optimization:

**"Enhancing Visitor Flow Prediction at Heritage Sites Using a Hybrid LSTM-Random Forest Model with Grey Wolf Optimization"**

### Justification:
- **Hybrid LSTM-Random Forest Model**: The title explicitly mentions the use of both LSTM networks and Random Forest algorithms, highlighting the hybrid nature of the model.
- **Grey Wolf Optimization**: The inclusion of Grey Wolf Optimization indicates the use of advanced optimization techniques to fine-tune the model parameters, enhancing predictive accuracy.
- **Visitor Flow Prediction**: The focus on predicting visitor flow at heritage sites aligns with the research objectives and methodology.
